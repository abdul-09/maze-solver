**Maze Solver Algorithm Implementation**

**Introduction:**
This Python project implements a maze solver algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to an end point within a maze. The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles, various search algorithms, and visualization techniques to solve mazes efficiently.

**Features:**
1. **Maze Generation:** The project includes functionality to generate random mazes of customizable sizes.
2. **Search Algorithms:** Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to traverse the maze and find the optimal path.
3. **Visualization:** Provides real-time visualization of the maze-solving process, allowing users to observe the algorithm's progress step by step.
4. **Customization:** Users can specify the size of the maze, the start and end points, and customize the appearance of the maze and path visualization.
5. **Performance Metrics:** Displays performance metrics such as the length of the shortest path found and the time taken to solve the maze.

**Usage:**
1. **Installation:** Clone the project repository from GitHub and install the required dependencies using pip.
2. **Execution:** Run the main Python script to launch the maze solver application.
3. **Interaction:** Use the GUI interface to generate random mazes, select search algorithms, and visualize the maze-solving process.
4. **Customization:** Modify parameters such as maze size, start and end points, and visualization settings as needed.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- NumPy (for array manipulation)
- Canvas (for visualization)
